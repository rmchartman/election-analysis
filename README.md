## Summary
In completing this election analysis, a repeatable process can easily be set in motion by applying a few changes to the code used to run the analysis. If the Election Commission desired more infomation, the code created could easily be augmented to find the votes per candidate in each county. This may help with future forcasting of outcomes per county.  Additionally, the data file only contained data with the Ballot ID, County, and Candidate, however, if there was more information such as voter demographics (like political party, education, or sex) the code could be edited to analyze the outcomes per candidate with a break down of what type of voter voted for each candidate.
